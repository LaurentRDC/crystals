User guide: crystals and lattices
=================================

Handling crystal models is the main feature of the :mod:`crystals` library. This is done through the :class:`Crystal` class, a representation of a crystal including 
unit cell atoms, lattice parameters, and other goodies.

Since working with :class:`Crystal` instances is so important, there are many ways to construct them.

Constructing a :class:`Crystal` object
--------------------------------------

Creating a :class:`Crystal` object can be done most easily from a Crystal Information File (CIF, .cif):
    
    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> diamond = Crystal.from_cif('diamond.cif') # doctest: +SKIP

:mod:`crystals` also has an internal database of CIF files. Valid names are stored in :attr:`Crystal.builtins` and can be
constructed like so:

    >>> Crystal.builtins # doctest: +SKIP
    frozenset({'Ac',
               'Ag',
               'Al',
               ...
               'alpha-Mn',
               'b-Pu',
               'diamond',
               'gamma-Pu'
               })
    >>> 'Au' in Crystal.builtins
    True
    >>> Crystal.from_database('Au') # doctest: +SKIP
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom Au @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.00)
        Atom Au @ (0.00, 0.50, 0.50)
        Atom Au @ (0.50, 0.00, 0.50)
        Atom Au @ (0.50, 0.50, 0.00)
    Lattice parameters:
        a=4.078Å, b=4.078Å, c=4.078Å
        α=90.000°, β=90.000°, γ=90.000°
    Chemical composition:
        Au: 100.000% >

`RCSB Protein DataBank <http://www.rcsb.org/>`_ files are even easier to handle; simply provide the 4-letter identification code
and the structure file will be taken care of by :mod:`crystals`:
    
    >>> hemoglobin = Crystal.from_pdb('1gzx')
    >>> print(hemoglobin)
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom C  @ (-0.50, 0.17, -0.05)
        Atom C  @ (-0.49, 0.19, -0.16)
        Atom C  @ (-0.49, 0.13, -0.15)
        Atom C  @ (-0.48, 0.30, -0.09)
        Atom C  @ (-0.48, 0.17, -0.06)
        Atom C  @ (-0.48, 0.17, -0.15)
        Atom C  @ (-0.48, 0.17, -0.04)
        Atom C  @ (-0.48, 0.23, -0.15)
        Atom C  @ (-0.47, 0.13, -0.16)
        Atom C  @ (-0.47, 0.23, -0.12)
          ... omitting 4554 atoms ...
          ... use repr() to show the full cell ... 
    Lattice parameters:
        a=97.050Å, b=99.500Å, c=66.110Å
        α=90.000°, β=90.000°, γ=90.000°
    Chemical composition:
         C: 64.724%
        Fe: 0.088%
         N: 17.090%
         O: 17.835%
         S: 0.263% >

Another convenient way to construct a :class:`Crystal` is through the `Crystallography Open Database <http://www.crystallography.net/cod/>`_:

    >>> # Default is the latest revision
    >>> vo2 = Crystal.from_cod(1521124)
    >>> # Revisions are accessible as well
    >>> old_vo2 = Crystal.from_cod(1521124, revision = 140771)

the `Materials Project <https://materialsproject.org/>`_ provides another avenue where to get crystal structures.
You will need an API key from your `account dashboard <https://materialsproject.org/dashboard>`_: 

    >>> fe2o3 = Crystal.from_mp(api_key="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", query = "Fe2O3") # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print(fe2o3) # doctest: +SKIP
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom Fe @ (0.89, 0.37, 0.67)
        Atom Fe @ (0.99, 0.75, 0.96)
        Atom Fe @ (0.49, 0.75, 0.79)
        Atom Fe @ (0.25, 0.51, 0.71)
        Atom Fe @ (0.13, 0.39, 0.92)
        Atom Fe @ (0.88, 0.12, 0.59)
        Atom Fe @ (0.38, 0.38, 0.84)
        Atom Fe @ (0.62, 0.62, 0.66)
        Atom Fe @ (0.61, 0.87, 0.58)
        Atom Fe @ (0.38, 0.38, 0.16)
        ... omitting 150 atoms ...
        ... use repr() to show the full cell ...
    Lattice parameters:
        a=8.525Å, b=8.525Å, c=25.593Å
        α=90.000°, β=90.000°, γ=90.000°
    Chemical composition:
         O: 60.000%
        Fe: 40.000% >

Other constructors are supported. See the reference for the :class:`Crystal` class for more details.

Constructing a :class:`Crystal` object by hand
----------------------------------------------
If you don't have a file on hand, or want to create an idealized crystal, consider building a :class:`Crystal`
object by hand.

To do this, you need:

1. iterable of :class:`Atom` objects, with coordinates. These atoms must be the full unit cell;
2. three lattice vectors;

As an example, let's create the simplest crystal structure known: 
`alpha-Polonium (simple cubic) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium#Solid_state_form>`_:
    
    >>> from crystals import Crystal, Atom
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>>
    >>> lattice_vectors = 3.35 * np.eye(3)
    >>> unitcell = [Atom('Po', coords = [0,0,0])]
    >>>
    >>> polonium = Crystal(unitcell, lattice_vectors)
    >>> polonium
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom Po @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.00)
    Lattice parameters:
        a=3.350Å, b=3.350Å, c=3.350Å
        α=90.000°, β=90.000°, γ=90.000°
    Chemical composition:
        Po: 100.000% >

In the case where atoms are given as an asymmetric unit cell and a set of symmetry operators, you can use the
:func:`symmetry_expansion` function to generate a set of *unique* atoms (even if some symmetry operators might be redundant).
The generated set of atoms can be passed to the constructor of :class:`Crystal`.

Converting a Crystal to other formats
-------------------------------------

You can use the `crystals` package to convert crystal structures from one format to another. Currently, you can write a structure 
either to an `.xyz` (:meth:`Crystal.to_xyz`) file, a Crystallography Information Framework `.cif` (:meth:`Crystal.to_cif`), 
or to an `ase.Atoms` structure (:meth:`Crystal.to_ase`). Here is an example:

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> 
    >>> # Create a crystal structure by hand
    >>> lattice_vectors = 3.35 * np.eye(3)
    >>> unitcell = [Atom('Po', coords = [0,0,0])]
    >>> polonium = Crystal(unitcell, lattice_vectors)
    >>> 
    >>> # Convert to CIF
    >>> polonium.to_cif('polonium.cif') # doctest: +SKIP

Would you like to convert to another format that is not supported yet? Please `raise an issue <https://github.com/LaurentRDC/crystals/issues/new>`_!

Crystal attributes
------------------
The :class:`Crystal` object provides some interfaces for easy structure manipulation. First, a :class:`Crystal` is an iterable:

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> 
    >>> for atm in graphite: # doctest: +SKIP
    ...	    print(repr(atm)) # doctest: +SKIP
    ...		
    < Atom C  @ (0.33, 0.67, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 0.75) >
    
The :func:`len` of a :class:`Crystal` is the unit cell size (in number of atoms):

    >>> hemoglobin = Crystal.from_pdb('1gzx')
    >>> len(hemoglobin)
    4564

The :class:`Crystal` class is a set-like container; checking containership (with the builtin ``in`` statement) is very fast:

    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> carbon = next(iter(graphite))			# Pick any atom from the crystal
    >>> 
    >>> carbon in graphite # doctest: +SKIP
    True

:class:`Crystal` instances can be equated to each other:

    >>> gold = Crystal.from_database('Au')
    >>> silver = Crystal.from_database('Ag')
    >>>
    >>> gold == silver
    False

Just like lists and other container types, a :class:`Crystal` instance is `False` if empty, and `True` otherwise:

    >>> mycrystal = Crystal.from_database('Cu')
    >>> if mycrystal: # equivalent to: if len(mycrystal) > 0:
    ...     pass

Structures can be extracted from a :class:`Crystal` instance by making use of its superclass, :class:`AtomicStructure`. For example, 
all atoms satisfying a certain condition can be found using `Crystal.satisfying`:

    >>> vo2 = Crystal.from_database('vo2-m1')
    >>> 
    >>> vo2.satisfying( lambda atom: atom.element == 'V' )
    < AtomicStructure object with following orphan atoms:
        Atom V  @ (0.24, 0.53, 0.53)
        Atom V  @ (0.24, 0.97, 0.03)
        Atom V  @ (0.76, 0.03, 0.97)
        Atom V  @ (0.76, 0.48, 0.47) >

To make it easier, take a look at the :func:`is_element` function:

    >>> from crystals import is_element
    >>>
    >>> vo2 = Crystal.from_database('vo2-m1')
    >>> vo2.satisfying( is_element('O') )
    < AtomicStructure object with following orphan atoms:
        Atom O  @ (0.10, 0.21, 0.20)
        Atom O  @ (0.10, 0.29, 0.70)
        Atom O  @ (0.39, 0.69, 0.29)
        Atom O  @ (0.39, 0.81, 0.79)
        Atom O  @ (0.61, 0.19, 0.21)
        Atom O  @ (0.61, 0.31, 0.71)
        Atom O  @ (0.90, 0.71, 0.30)
        Atom O  @ (0.90, 0.79, 0.80) >

If a :class:`Crystal` was generated from a file, the path to its file can be retrieved
from the :attr:`source` attribute:

    >>> hemoglobin = Crystal.from_pdb('1gzx')
    >>> print(hemoglobin.source) # doctest: +SKIP 
    '(...omitted...)\pdb1gzx.ent'

:class:`Crystal` instances have a nice string representation (with :func:`str`), and a complete string representation (with :func:`repr`):

    >>> vo2 = Crystal.from_database('vo2-m1')
    >>> print(vo2)	   # Short string representation
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom O  @ (0.10, 0.21, 0.20)
        Atom O  @ (0.10, 0.29, 0.70)
        Atom O  @ (0.39, 0.69, 0.29)
        Atom O  @ (0.39, 0.81, 0.79)
        Atom O  @ (0.61, 0.19, 0.21)
        Atom O  @ (0.61, 0.31, 0.71)
        Atom O  @ (0.90, 0.71, 0.30)
        Atom O  @ (0.90, 0.79, 0.80)
        Atom V  @ (0.24, 0.53, 0.53)
        Atom V  @ (0.24, 0.97, 0.03)
          ... omitting 2 atoms ...
          ... use repr() to show the full cell ...
    Lattice parameters:
        a=5.743Å, b=4.517Å, c=5.375Å
        α=90.000°, β=122.600°, γ=90.000°
    Chemical composition:
         O: 66.667%
         V: 33.333% >
    

:class:`Crystal` instances can be converted to NumPy arrays as well:

    >>> import numpy
    >>> numpy.array(Crystal.from_database('Si'))
    array([[14.  ,  0.  ,  0.  ,  0.  ],
           [14.  ,  0.  ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ],
           [14.  ,  0.25,  0.25,  0.25],
           [14.  ,  0.25,  0.75,  0.75],
           [14.  ,  0.5 ,  0.  ,  0.5 ],
           [14.  ,  0.5 ,  0.5 ,  0.  ],
           [14.  ,  0.75,  0.25,  0.75],
           [14.  ,  0.75,  0.75,  0.25]])

:data:`arr` will contain one row per unit cell atom:

You can calculate what the asymmetric cell of a :class:`Class` is with the :meth:`Crystal.asymmetric_cell()`
method:

    >>> Crystal.from_database('C').asymmetric_cell() # doctest: +SKIP
    {< Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.25) >, 
     < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 0.75) >}


.. table::
    :widths: grid

    +--------------+-----------------------+
    |Atomic Number |Fractional coordinates |
    +==============+=======+========+======+
    |      Z1      |  x1   |   y1   |  z1  |
    +--------------+-------+--------+------+
    |      Z2      |  x2   |   y2   |  z2  |
    +--------------+-------+--------+------+
    |      Z3      |  x3   |   y3   |  z3  |
    +--------------+-------+--------+------+
    |            ...                       |
    +--------------------------------------+


Lattice vectors and reciprocal space
------------------------------------
Once a :class:`Crystal` object is ready, you can manipulate the lattice parameters via the :class:`Lattice`
super-class. Let's use the built-in example of graphite:

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> 
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> 	
    >>> a1, a2, a3 = graphite.lattice_vectors
    >>> a1
    array([ 2.13388659e+00, -1.23200000e+00,  1.50876486e-16])
    >>> b1, b2, b3 = graphite.reciprocal_vectors
    >>> b1
    array([2.94447949, 0.        , 0.        ])
    >>>
    >>> np.dot(a1, b1)	# 2 pi
    6.283185307179586

The standard `three lengths and angles` description of a lattice is also accessible:

    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> a, b, c, alpha, beta, gamma = graphite.lattice_parameters

The unit cell volume (and by extensions, density) is also accessible:

    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> vol = graphite.volume	# Angstroms cubed
    >>> density = vol/len(graphite)

As a lattice can be fully described by its basis vectors, a NumPy array can be created from a :class:`Lattice` instance.

Space-group Information
-----------------------
The `lattice system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice#Bravais_lattices_in_3_dimensions>`_ of a Lattice or Crystal instance is also available via the :attr:`lattice_system` attribute:

    >>> vo2 = Crystal.from_database('vo2-m1') # Monoclinic M1 VO2
    >>> vo2.lattice_system
    <LatticeSystem.monoclinic: 2>

Better control on length tolerances is available via the :func:`lattice_system` function.

Thanks to `spglib <http://atztogo.github.io/spglib/>`_, we can get space-group information from a :class:`Crystal` instance:

    >>> from pprint import pprint # pretty printing
    >>>
    >>> gold = Crystal.from_database('Au')
    >>> pprint(gold.symmetry())
    {'centering': <CenteringType.face_centered: 'F'>,
     'hall_number': 523,
     'hall_symbol': '-F 4 2 3',
     'hm_symbol': 'Fm-3m',
     'international_full': 'F 4/m -3 2/m',
     'international_number': 225,
     'international_symbol': 'Fm-3m',
     'pointgroup': 'm-3m'}

In the above example, :data:`spg_info` is a dictionary with the following keys:

1. ``'international_symbol'``: International Tables of Crystallography space-group symbol (short);

2. ``'international_full'``: International Tables of Crystallography space-group full symbol;

3. ``'hall_symbol'`` : Hall symbol;

4. ``'hm_symbol'`` : Hermann-Mauguin symbol;

5. ``'pointgroup'`` : International Tables of Crystallography point-group;

6. ``'international_number'`` : International Tables of Crystallography space-group number (between 1 and 230);

7. ``'hall_number'`` : Hall number (between 1 and 531).

Each of those items are also available directly from the :class:`Crystal` instance. The Hall number of a crystal structure 
is located in the :attr:`Crystal.hall_number` attribute, the short international symbol is located in the :attr:`Crystal.international_symbol`. 
attribute, and so on.

Symmetry operations
-------------------
You can get the matrix symmetry operations directly from the :class:`Crystal` class:

    >>> cryst = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> first_symop = cryst.symmetry_operations()[0]
    >>> 
    >>> print(first_symop)
    [[1. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 1. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 1. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 1.]]
    
Symmetry operations are described using 4x4 affine matrices, where the rotation is the top 3x3 block,
and the translation is the right-most column. Example with iteration:

    >>> for m in cryst.symmetry_operations():
    ...     rotation = m[:3, :3]
    ...     translation = m[:3, -1]
    ...
    >>>

Symmetry operations in reciprocal space are also made available via :meth:`Crystal.reciprocal_symmetry_operations`.


Grouping atoms by site-symmetry
-------------------------------

For various reasons, it might be useful to know which of the atoms in a :class:`Crystal` are related by some site symmetry, for example Wyckoff letters
or crystallographic orbits. This can be done with the :meth:`Crystal.groupby` method, which groups atoms according to their site symmetry. For example:

    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> groups = graphite.groupby(by="crystallographic_orbits")
    >>> for orbit, atoms in groups.items():                                         # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(f"Orbit {orbit}: {atoms}")                                        # doctest: +SKIP
    ...                                                                             # doctest: +SKIP
    Orbit 0: [< Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.25) >, < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.75) >]   # doctest: +SKIP
    Orbit 2: [< Atom C  @ (0.33, 0.67, 0.25) >, < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 0.75) >]   # doctest: +SKIP

Supported site-symmetry measures are currently `"crystallographic_orbits"`, `"wyckoffs"`, and `"equivalent_atoms"`. See 
the `spglib <http://atztogo.github.io/spglib/>`_ documentation for a description of these measures of symmetry.

Cell refinements and manipulations
----------------------------------

Again, through `spglib <http://atztogo.github.io/spglib/>`_, we can create different versions of :class:`Crystal` instances. For example,
a primitive :class:`Crystal` can be created using the :meth:`Crystal.primitive` method:

    >>> gold = Crystal.from_database('Au')
    >>> print(gold)
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom Au @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.00)
        Atom Au @ (0.00, 0.50, 0.50)
        Atom Au @ (0.50, 0.00, 0.50)
        Atom Au @ (0.50, 0.50, 0.00)
    Lattice parameters:
        a=4.078Å, b=4.078Å, c=4.078Å
        α=90.000°, β=90.000°, γ=90.000°
    Chemical composition:
        Au: 100.000% >
    >>>
    >>> primitive_gold = gold.primitive() # this is a whole new Crystal instance
    >>> print(primitive_gold) # doctest: +SKIP
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom Au @ (0.00, 0.00, -0.00)
    Lattice parameters:
        a=2.884Å, b=2.884Å, c=2.884Å
        α=60.000°, β=60.000°, γ=60.000°
    Chemical composition:
        Au: 100.000% >

Notice how the primitive structure is much simpler.

Idealized versions of :class:`Crystal` objects are also made available. Let's take the example of iron arsenide:

    >>> iron_arsenide = Crystal.from_database('FeAs')
    >>> print(iron_arsenide)
    < Crystal object with following unit cell:
        Atom As @ (0.20, 0.58, 0.25)
        Atom As @ (0.30, 0.08, 0.75)
        Atom As @ (0.70, 0.92, 0.25)
        Atom As @ (0.80, 0.42, 0.75)
        Atom Fe @ (0.00, 0.20, 0.25)
        Atom Fe @ (0.50, 0.70, 0.75)
        Atom Fe @ (0.50, 0.30, 0.25)
        Atom Fe @ (1.00, 0.80, 0.75)

Scattering utilities
--------------------

:class:`Lattice` objects have a few methods that make life easier when dealing with scattering data and modeling.

The conversion between Miller indices and scattering vectors is available:

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>>
    >>> # Behavior inherited from Lattice superclass
    >>> e1 = (1, 0, 0)
    >>> G = graphite.scattering_vector(e1)
    >>> graphite.miller_indices(G)
    array([1., 0., 0.])

Since version 1.3, the calculation of Miller indices or scattering vectors is much faster 
for tables of indices, where every row corresponds to a reflection/scattering vector:

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>>
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>> indices = np.array([
    ...    [1,0,0],
    ...    [1,1,0],
    ...    [1,2,1],
    ...    [2,0,0],
    ... ])
    >>> graphite.scattering_vector(indices)
    array([[2.94447949, 0.        , 0.        ],
           [4.41671923, 2.54999404, 0.        ],
           [5.88895897, 5.09998807, 0.93625172],
           [5.88895897, 0.        , 0.        ]])

Supercells
----------
For various reasons, creating a supercell from a crystal might be desirable. The process is very easy. 
Let's imagine we want to create a 2x2x2 supercell of graphite:

    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>> graphite = Crystal.from_database('C')
    >>>
    >>> for atm in sorted(graphite): # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(repr(atm))         # doctest: +SKIP
    ...                              # doctest: +SKIP
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.33, 0.67, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 0.75) >
    >>>
    >>> for atm in sorted(graphite.supercell(2,2,2)): # doctest: +SKIP
    ...    print(repr(atm))                           # doctest: +SKIP
    ...                                               # doctest: +SKIP
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 1.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 0.00, 1.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 1.00, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 1.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 1.00, 1.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.00, 1.00, 1.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.33, 0.67, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.33, 0.67, 1.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.33, 1.67, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.33, 1.67, 1.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 0.33, 1.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 1.33, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (0.67, 1.33, 1.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 0.00, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 0.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 0.00, 1.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 0.00, 1.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 1.00, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 1.00, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 1.00, 1.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.00, 1.00, 1.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.33, 0.67, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.33, 0.67, 1.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.33, 1.67, 0.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.33, 1.67, 1.25) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.67, 0.33, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.67, 0.33, 1.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.67, 1.33, 0.75) >
    < Atom C  @ (1.67, 1.33, 1.75) >

Supercells are generated by copying unit cells along crystallographic axes. For example, a 2x3x5 supercell will be extended by 2x along 
the ``a1`` lattice vector, extended by 3x along the ``a2`` lattice vector, and extended by 5x along the ``a3`` lattice vector.

:class:`Supercell` objects can be used anywhere a :class:`Crystal` object can be used. With the addition of all methods and attributes
from the :class:`Crystal` class, a :class:`Supercell` object also has two extra attributes:

1. :attr:`Supercell.dimensions`: Integer supercell dimensions. For example, for a 3x2x1 supercell, the dimensions are ``(3,2,1)``.
2. :attr:`Supercell.scaled_lattice_vectors`: Lattice vectors scaled by the :attr:`Supercell.dimensions`.


Compatibility with ASE
----------------------
The `Atomic Simulation Environment <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html>`_ is a powerful tool. You can harness its power and convert
between :class:`ase.Atoms` and :class:`crystals.Crystal` at will.

To create an :class:`ase.Atoms` object from a :class:`Crystal`, use the :meth:`Crystal.ase_atoms` method:

    >>> from ase.calculators.abinit import Abinit # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> from crystals import Crystal
    >>>                             
    >>> gold = Crystal.from_database('Au')
    >>> ase_gold = gold.to_ase(calculator = Abinit(...)) # doctest: +SKIP

All keywords of the :class:`ase.Atoms` constructor are supported. To get back to a :class:`Crystal` instance:

    >>> gold2 = Crystal.from_ase(ase_gold) # doctest: +SKIP
